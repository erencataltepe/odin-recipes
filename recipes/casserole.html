    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This chilaquiles breakfast casserole is made with layered tortilla chips,
      baked in a spiced chile sauce and cheese. Topped with fried or poached
      eggs, and plenty of delicious fixings, it's very satisfying. Traditional
      chilaquiles are made in a skillet, but this casserole version is a great
      way to serve a large group at breakfast or a brunch.
