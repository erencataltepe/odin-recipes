    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This fabulous cinnamon-raisin French toast recipe should be prepared the
      night before baking. It's always a hit with friends and family and is best
      served with something salty on the side such as bacon or sausage. Enjoy!
      Can also be topped off with real maple syrup for an extra sweet treat.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup unsalted butter</li>
      <li>12 slices cinnamon raisin bread</li>
      <li>6 large eggs</li>
      <li>2 cups milk</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring white sugar, brown sugar, and butter to a boil in a saucepan over
        medium heat; boil, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour 1/3 of the mixture into a buttered 9x13-inch baking pan. Layer 1/2
        of the bread slices on top of the mixture. Pour another 1/3 of the sugar
        mixture on top of the first layer of bread, then add remaining bread
        slices and set aside. Reserve remaining sugar mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat eggs, milk, and vanilla extract together in a medium mixing bowl
        and pour over bread. Cover the dish with foil and refrigerate, 8 hours
        to overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Uncover the dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center
        comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Serve with remaining glaze as syrup.
