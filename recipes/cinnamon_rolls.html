    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup milk</li>
      <li>1/3 cup butter</li>
      <li>1 (0.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>3 large eggs</li>
      <li>3/4 cup brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1/2 cup raisins</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon light corn syrup</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups sifted confectioners' sugar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons half-and-half cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat milk in a small saucepan over medium heat until bubbles form around
        the edge, but do not let it boil. Remove from heat. Add butter and stir
        until melted. Let cool until the mixture reaches 100 to 110 degrees F
        (38 to 43 degrees C)—warm to the touch but not hot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour cooled milk mixture into a large mixing bowl. Gently sprinkle yeast
        over warm milk and let stand until dissolved and foamy, about 5 minutes.
        Add sugar, 3 cups of flour, salt, and eggs; stir well to combine.
        Gradually add remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring well after
        each addition. When dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a
        lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and supple, about 8
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lightly oil a large mixing bowl, place dough in bowl and turn to coat
        with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until
        doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Deflate dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and roll
        into a 10x14-inch rectangle. Lightly brush the far edge with water. In a
        small bowl combine cinnamon and 3/4 cup brown sugar and sprinkle over
        the rectangle. Then sprinkle raisins and chopped nuts over dough. Roll
        up dough into a log and seal the seam.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut dough into 12 equal pieces; place the pieces in a greased 9x13-inch
        baking pan, or 12-inch deep dish pizza pan. Cover with plastic wrap and
        place in the refrigerator to rise overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        The next morning, preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Take
        rolls out of the refrigerator and let stand at room temperature for 30
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake rolls in the preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes or until golden.
        Meanwhile, combine corn syrup with vanilla in a small bowl. Whisk in
        powdered sugar and enough cream to make a thick glaze; set aside.
        Drizzle glaze over warm cinnamon rolls before serving.
